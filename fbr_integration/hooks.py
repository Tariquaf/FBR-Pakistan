# Required apps
# ------------------
# ERPNext v16.x is required (Sales Invoice / Sales Invoice Item / Item / Customer
# doctypes this app extends). Frappe itself is implicit and doesn't need listing.
required_apps = ["erpnext"]

# Includes in <head>
# ------------------
# app_include_css = "/assets/fbr_integration/css/fbr_integration.css"
# app_include_js = "/assets/fbr_integration/js/fbr_integration.js"

# Client side script attached to specific doctypes
# -------------------------------------------------
doctype_js = {
	"Sales Invoice": "public/js/sales_invoice.js",
}

# Fixtures
# --------
# Custom Fields (Item, Customer, Sales Invoice, Sales Invoice Item) are shipped
# as fixtures so `bench migrate` recreates them automatically on every site.
fixtures = [
	{
		"dt": "Custom Field",
		"filters": [["module", "in", ["FBR Integration"]], ["dt", "in", [
			"Item", "Customer", "Sales Invoice", "Sales Invoice Item"
		]]]
	}
]

# Document Events
# ---------------
# 1) `before_save` recalculates the FBR tax breakup on every Sales Invoice save
#    (equivalent to the "FBR Tax Calculation" server script in the guide).
# 2) `on_submit` is left commented out by default: the app ships with a
#    "Send to FBR" button (see public/js/sales_invoice.js) instead of an
#    automatic submit-time push. Uncomment on_submit below if you prefer the
#    invoice to be sent to FBR automatically the moment it is submitted.
